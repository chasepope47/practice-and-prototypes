# 🧪 Practice and Prototypes

A curated collection of practice exercises, experimental projects, and early-stage prototypes built while exploring different programming languages, frameworks, and development concepts.  
This repository serves as a personal sandbox for learning, testing ideas, and sharpening software development skills.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This repo exists to:

- Practice coding in multiple languages  
- Experiment with new tools, libraries, and frameworks  
- Build small prototypes before turning them into full projects  
- Document learning progress over time  
- Provide a clean space for testing ideas without pressure

## 🧠 Knowledge & Skill Evidence

Below are tools, languages, and technologies I have hands-on experience with.  
Each includes a small proof-of-knowledge project, script, config, or write-up.

### 🔹 Programming Languages
- **C++** — basic programs, compilers, OOP practice → `cpp/basics/`
- **C#** — console apps, Windows tooling → `csharp/basics/`
- **Java** — OOP, algorithms, project structure → `java/exercises/`
- **JavaScript** — CLI tools, DOM practice → `javascript/*`
- **Python** — automation, hashing tool, scanning → `python/*`
- **Bash** — Linux scripting, backups → `bash/*`
- **PowerShell** — Windows admin scripts → `powershell/*`

### 🔹 Web Development
- **HTML5** — forms, layouts → `html-css/web-labs/`
- **CSS3** — styling basics
- **JavaScript** — frontend and backend practice

### 🔹 Cloud & Databases
- **AWS, Google Cloud, Firebase** — (coming soon) cloud notes + starter projects
- **SQL / Microsoft SQL Server / DynamoDB** — example schemas → `sql/queries/`

### 🔹 Security, Networking, & Systems
- **Cisco / Networking** — ping sweeps, packet analysis → `networking/scripts/`
- **Docker** — containerized Minecraft servers + dev containers
- **Bitwarden / OpenAPI / Auth** — security notes (CTF + labs coming)
- **Windows Terminal** — customization + scripts → `powershell/`
- **Linux** — bash scripts, system tasks → `bash/linux-scripts/`

### 🔹 Hardware & Platforms
- **Raspberry Pi** — projects & configs (coming)
- **Ubiquiti / Networking Lab** — homelab setups & VLAN configs
- **AMD, NVIDIA** — compute + gaming configs (notes soon)

### 🔹 Gaming / Engines (for fun projects)
- **Unity / Unreal Engine** — prototype folders (coming)
- **Steam / EA / Ubisoft / Riot / Xbox** — configs & scripting notes

## 🧠 Learning Focus

Some concepts you'll see practiced here:

- Data structures & algorithms  
- API testing  
- Automation scripts  
- Object-oriented programming  
- Networking & security basics  
- Full-stack experiments  
- Minecraft server scripting (optional)  
- Anything else I feel like trying

## 📜 Notes

This repository is a learning space — not all code will be polished, optimized, or production-ready.  
The goal is **growth**, not perfection.
