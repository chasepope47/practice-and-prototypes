# 🧪 Practice and Prototypes

A curated collection of practice exercises, experimental projects, and early-stage prototypes built while exploring different programming languages, frameworks, and development concepts.  
This repository serves as a personal sandbox for learning, testing ideas, and sharpening software development skills.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This repo exists to:

- Practice coding in multiple languages  
- Experiment with new tools, libraries, and frameworks  
- Build small prototypes before turning them into full projects  
- Document learning progress over time  
- Provide a clean space for testing ideas without pressure

## 📜 Notes

This repository is a learning space — not all code will be polished, optimized, or production-ready.  
The goal is **growth**, not perfection.
